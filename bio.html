I am a composer, sound designer, and audio engineer for film, video games, and media. 
          I hold a Master of Music degree in music technology 
          and digital media from the University of Toronto. Having a background in 
          the natural sciences and in piano performance, my approach to composition 
          and audio production combines an intuition for musicality with a quantitative analysis of sound. 
      </p>
      <p>
My music merges electronic and acoustic sound sources 
          in a way that highlights the advantages of both
          media with an understanding of their equal capacity 
          for musical expressiveness. I take inspiration from a wide
          range of musical styles throughout history, drawing upon my
          classical training and my appreciation for contemporary film and
          popular music. My sounds are a constant attempt to find parallels 
          between the harmonies of different genres and eras so that
          my own works can reflect what I find most musically effective among these disparate styles.
 </p>
      <p>
I have produced music and sound effects for a variety of projects, 
          from indie films and video games to internet ads to web series. 
          I have also produced and engineered a number of small ensemble jazz 
          and classical studio recordings. Additionally, I have written and 
          produced singles and EPs that have exhibited a less narratively 
          constrained variation of my compositional style from my work in audio for media.
 </p>
      <p>
Ultimately, my goal is to create great acoustical experiences, whether that be in the form 
          of my personal compositions, composition and sound design for other forms 
          of media, or in enhancing the works of other musicians.
